## Experimental system and theory

**System:** Extended English Stenotype + &_

Below are various additional experimental mechanics present here that have been added to supplement Plover theory.

### `#`
`#` denotes proper nouns (and other parts of speech) and initialisms. Many of the entries that use this mechanic are found in `number-key-proper-nouns.json` and `number-key-proper-nouns-main-dict-worthy.json`.

E.g., `#PHAT` â‡’ `Matt`.

This addition has been made due to the high incidence of conflicts between proper words in `main.json`. `main.json` usually uses asterisks and stroke duplications to denote proper nouns, but the high number of combinations between these two make it difficult to determine what the resulting spelling will be. It is also uncertain whether the entries for common proper nouns will even exist, as seen through the high number of misstroke entries that counteract redundant stroke duplications in `main.json`.

### `^`
`^` denotes affixes and segments of compound words. It (along with any other symbol modifiers described below) is usually added to the first stroke that comprises the affix. Many of the entries that use this mechanic are found in `caret-affixes.json`.
* `^` alone usuaully indicates a suffix, e.g., `^HRAOEUBG` â‡’ `{^}like`.
* The addition of `*` usuaully indicates a prefix, e.g., `^PH*E/TA` â‡’ `meta{^}`.
  * The typical usage of `*` for variations, conflicts, and certain sounds still applies in some circumstances, e.g., `^WO*RT/KWREU` â‡’ `{^}worthy`.
  * `*` functions as a toggle (i.e., if a stroke that already contains `*` would need another `*` added to it, then the stroke should not have a `*`), e.g., `^ORT` â‡’ `ortho{^}`. (Find single-stroke entries with the regex `^"[^*]+": ".+\{\^\}",$`)
* The addition of `#` usuaully indicates hyphenation, e.g., `#^TPRAOE` â‡’ `{^}-free`.
  * The usage in the previous section still applies; `#` can also be used for proper words, e.g., `#WEUPBG` â‡’ `{*-|}{^}Wing`.

`^` is also uncommonly used to indicate the letter `A` for briefing purposes.

This addition has been made due to the high incidence/load of conflicts and the unpredictability that arises whenever ad-libbing an affix stroke in `main.json`. The high load of conflicts causes `main.json` to resort to arbitrary phoneme replacements and briefs that are difficult to predict without previous memorization and knowledge of their existence. `main.json` also uses `*` to convert some words into affixes and link together segments of compound words, but this may fall short when a conflict that uses `*` already exists, and it is unpredictable whether the affix will be hyphenated or not.

### `+`
`+` currently has no use.

### `_`
`_` tentatively denotes symbols and punctuation. Many of the entries that use this mechanic are found in `underscore-symbols-and-text-commands.json`.

### `&`
`&` is used exclusively for entry to/exit from the orthographic spelling system.
