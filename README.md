## Experimental system and theory

**System:** Extended English Stenotype + &_

Below are various additional experimental mechanics present here that have been added to supplement Plover theory.

### `#`
`#` denotes proper nouns (and other parts of speech) and initialisms. It is usually added to the first stroke that comprises the word or phrase. Many of the entries that use this mechanic are found in `numberkey-proper-nouns.json` and `numberkey-proper-nouns-user.json`.
* *[Potential change] Require the `#` modifier for each stroke that starts a new word in the proper noun*
  * *[Unclear] When to use `#` for pascal-case proper nouns*

E.g., `#PHAT` â‡’ `Matt`.

#### Caveats
* Do strokes containing `#` obey rules for prefix strokes? How should compound words and multiword titles be handled?

#### Motivation
This addition has been made due to the high incidence of conflicts between proper words in `main.json`. `main.json` usually uses asterisks and stroke duplications to denote proper nouns, but the high number of combinations between these two make it difficult to determine what the resulting spelling/formatting will be. It is also uncertain whether the entries for common proper nouns will even exist, as seen through the high number of misstroke entries that counteract redundant stroke duplications in `main.json`.

### `^`
`^` denotes affixes and segments of compound words. `^` and `*` (to denote prefixes) are added to all strokes that comprise the affix, but `#` is only added to the first stroke. Many of the entries that use this mechanic are found in `caret-affixes.json`.
* `^` alone usually indicates a suffix, e.g., `^HRAOEUBG` â‡’ `{^}like`.
* The addition of `*` usually indicates a prefix, e.g., `^PH*E/^TA*` â‡’ `meta{^}`.
  * The typical uses of `*` for variations, conflicts, and chords that use `*` still apply in some circumstances, e.g., `^WO*RT/^KWREU` â‡’ `{^}worthy`.
  * `*` functions as a toggle (i.e., if a stroke that already contains `*` would need another `*` added to it, then the stroke should not have a `*`), e.g., `^ORT` â‡’ `ortho{^}`. (Find single-stroke entries with the regex `^"[^*]+": ".+\{\^\}",$`)
* The addition of `#` usually indicates hyphenation, e.g., `#^TPRAOE` â‡’ `{^}-free`.
  * `#` can still be used for proper words or proper affixes, e.g., `#^WEUPBG` â‡’ `{*-|}{^}Wing`.
* *[Unclear] When to use `^` or `#` for pascal-case proper nouns*

`^` is also uncommonly used to indicate the letter `A` for briefing purposes.

#### Caveats
* It is still necessary to semantically distinguish between affix strokes and other strokes, and to determine which parts of words are affixes.
  * Since `main.json`'s affix strokes do not have additional modifiers, it is possible to discover some of them through typical syllable splitting without first knowing they are affixes (although this falls apart in the case of conflicts, as described below). All `^` affixes are marked, so this is not possible to do with `^`.
  * If a word can be written using an affix stroke, when should an outline that uses typical syllable splitting without affix strokes be considered incorrect?
* When should `^` strokes be explicitly added to outlines for full words? Only when the root alone is not a word or changes spelling? When can the `^` strokes really be considered "affixes"? (e.g., `TPHUPL/^PAD` â‡’ `numpad`, `TUP/^HRET` â‡’ `tuplet`)
* The rule of adding modifiers to the first stroke may not neccessarily be consistent in the case of ambiguities and potential conflicts; e.g., `{^}alike` should be stroked `^A/^HRAOEUBG` instead of `^A/HRAOEUBG`.

#### Motivation
This addition has been made due to the high incidence/load of conflicts and the unpredictability that arises whenever ad-libbing an affix stroke in `main.json`. The high load of conflicts causes `main.json` to resort to arbitrary phoneme replacements and briefs that are difficult to predict without previous memorization and knowledge of their existence. `main.json` also uses `*` to convert some words into affixes and link together segments of compound words, but this may fall short when a conflict that uses `*` already exists. It is additionally unpredictable whether the affix will be hyphenated or not, and the need for hyphens may vary depending on style.

This is not intended as a complete replacement for the built-in affix strokes, which are at times more convenient and ergonomic, and more easily merged into other strokes.

### `+`
`+` currently has no use.

### `_`
`_` tentatively denotes symbols and punctuation. Many of the entries that use this mechanic are found in `underscore-symbols-and-text-commands.json`.

### `&`
`&` is used exclusively for entry to/exit from the orthographic spelling system.
